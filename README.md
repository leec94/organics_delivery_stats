# Organics Delivery Stats
My local organics delivery box preference scripts for Airtable. 

I had the question "how well does my preferences denoted in the delivery site match up with the veggies I recieve bi-weekly?" \
So I created an Airtable of various tables to help answer this question. The Airtable base is not publically available, but I am uploading this script to keep it nice and safe. 

This code is specifically for Airtable Scripts, so it uses Airtable objects and functions. More details here: https://airtable.com/developers/scripting/api
